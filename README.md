IEEE P1484.2 Recommended Practices for Learning and Employment Record (LER) Ecosystems are intended to help system architects, and engineers design and deploy systems that leverage shared standards and technologies to support ecosystem-scale issuing, holding, and presenting verifiable credentials for education and employment achievements and related data.

Context
Problem statement:  Over the last 150 years, practice-based learning was substantially displaced by institution-provided education, leading to equity and efficiency gaps in the global talent supply chain.  Emerging approaches like Digital Badges are rapidly expanding, growing 73% in 2021 to 74,780,775 badges issued globally.1
 
Solution objective: What is needed is a new, global, “Internet of Education2,” driven by open standards and shared technical resources and managed by distributed governance, in which verifiable credentials with evidence for people’s employment experiences and unbundled skills become machine-readable data that can be held and controlled from a self-sovereign identity (SSI) and digital wallet app and valued like currency for learning and employment opportunities on the open Internet, the way goods and services are exchanged today.

Scope boundaries.  This standard is not primarily intended to support more traditional “system to system” data sharing agreements; the IEEE project P2997 and other standards are intended to address models for data at rest in enterprise system and  system-to-system data exchanges  (Figure 1).

This standard is intended to support scenarios in which the subject of Learning and Employment Records (LER records) or their adult parent/guardian holds LER records as Verifiable Credentials, and is in control of the delivery of Verifiable Presentations of those LER Records to Reviewers (Figure 2)

Core Supported Scenario.  When an LER Awarder records evidence of a person’s mastery of one or more competency or credential description, an LER Transmitter can publish a verifiable credential to the LER Holder.  The LER Holder can then curate and control verifiable presentation to a LER Reviewer.  The LER Reviewer can trust and automate action based on the Learning and Employment Record without the need for a direct relationship with the LER Awarder or Transmitter.  To meet this scenario in a way acceptable globally, the solution should incorporate principles of privacy by design and self sovereign identity management.
